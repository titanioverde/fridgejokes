		<header>What is this? (I don't even)</header>
		<p>Fridge Jokes is an entertainment web application oriented to people who have played the videogame Persona 4.</p>
		<p>During most ingame days, the main character has the option to check the fridge in his home. He may find a little surprise, usually food of different kinds, and the player will decide to interact (eat, drink, etc.) with it. Sometimes it will result in some bonus, or will turn the character sick.</p>
		<p>Some certains related videos on Youtube have a significant amount of comments mimicking the text shown during these interactions with the fridge, becoming jokes on their own. And the raison d'Ãªtre of this page is to collect these jokes and to show them in a fashion similar to the original videogame.</p>

		<header>Why create a whole website just for jokes that few people will really understand?</header>
		<p>For me, the developer, was a nice excuse to put my beginner skills in action, being this my second web project shown to the public.</p>
		<p>Thus, I hope this web application will serve me well in my future professional portfolio.</p>
		<p>Also, the internet is full of humour of all kinds, and there is always place for more.</p>

		<header>Which framework did you use for this app?</header>
		<p>None, except if you consider jQuery a framework, which is being used for asynchronous calls (AJAX) and some animations. The pages are processed on PHP, and use some HTML5 and CSS3 features.</p>
		<p>Another library used here is <a href='http://leaverou.github.com/prefixfree/'>Prefix Free</a>, to ease CSS3 compatibility.</p>

		<p><i>Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4</i>. A relatively famous japanese RPG from Atlus, for PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Vita. It also has its own animation series.</p>

		<header>I haven't played any of this. Will I laugh anyway?</header>
		<p>You can try. Many jokes, as usual on the internet, are crossed with other memes. Some even can be easy to understand for everyone.</p>

		<header>How can I describe the kind of humour shown here?</header>
		<p>As Bryan o'Doyle said at <a href='http://www.koding.com'>Koding</a>: "well that's a perfect illustration of the specificity of appeal of various forms of humour; I laughed till the tears came, going back and forth through those panels. It is a shredding of dreaming and video games and psychoanalysis and pop culture and domesticity in this surreal space carved out of the multiverse."</p>
